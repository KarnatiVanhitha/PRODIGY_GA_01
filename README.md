# GPT-2 Text Generation Fine-Tuning Project

This project focuses on fine-tuning OpenAI's GPT-2 model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a custom dataset. The goal is to train the model to mimic the style and structure of the training data for applications such as automated content creation, story generation, or chatbot development.

 Project Overview

- **Model**: GPT-2 (by OpenAI)
- **Task**: Text generation using a custom dataset
- **Approach**: Fine-tuning the pre-trained GPT-2 on domain-specific data
- **Tools & Libraries**:
  - Python
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - PyTorch or TensorFlow
  - Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
  - Weights & Biases (optional for experiment tracking)

 Dataset

- Provide your custom dataset in `.txt` or `.csv` format.
- Make sure the data is clean and structured appropriately for language modeling.
 How It Works

1. **Preprocess** the data into a suitable format.
2. **Tokenize** the text using the GPT-2 tokenizer.
3. **Fine-tune** the GPT-2 model using the Hugging Face `Trainer` API.
4. **Save** the fine-tuned model.
5. **Generate** new text samples based on prompts.

 Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt2-text-generation.git
cd gpt2-text-generation

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Training the Model


python train.py \
  --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
  --train_file data/your_dataset.txt \
  --output_dir model/ \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 2 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --save_steps 500
Tip: Use Google Colab or a GPU environment for faster training.

Generating Text

python generate.py \
  --model_path model/ \
  --prompt "Once upon a time" \
  --max_length 100
Example Output
Prompt: The future of AI lies in

Generated:

The future of AI lies in its ability to adapt, learn, and evolve in real time. With advancements in machine learning and cognitive computing, AI systems will soon be able to reason, empathize, and make complex decisions across various domains...
